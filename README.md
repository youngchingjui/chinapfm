# Chinese Personal Financial Management Tool

I will build a simple website that aggregates your WeChat Pay, Alipay and your Chinese bank transactions so you can better understand your spending patterns.

## Infrastructure

This application will be deployed through AWS Amplify, connected to this Github repository.
The front-end and backend will both be deployed through this repository.

## Next steps

- Setup simple front-end webpage to upload transactions CSVs and merge across platforms
- Develop backend logic for wrangling raw CSV transaction downloads
- Clean uploaded CSVs for upload into #LunchMoney.app
- Setup cheap AWS Lightsail server to serve front-end and backend resources
- Wonâ€™t buy domain name just yet - will use out-of-box AWS domain

## Later steps

- Build database to store your data
- Build simple front-end table and graphs to show your transactions
